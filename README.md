# E-Commerce Transactions Analysis

This project analyzes **50k+ e-commerce transactions** to uncover revenue, profit, and customer trends. 
It demonstrates **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** for data cleaning and EDA, 
**SQL** for querying and aggregations, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and KPI reporting.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze revenue, profit, and margin trends across products, regions, and customers  
- Identify repeat purchase behavior and customer value drivers  
- Create actionable insights for business decision-making through dashboards  

---

## Tools & Skills
- **Python** – pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA  
- **SQL** – queries for revenue/profit summaries, cohorts, and customer segmentation  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboards with slicers, KPI cards, and trend charts  

---

## Example Business Questions
- Which product categories and regions generate the most profit?  
- How do profit margins vary across customer groups?  
- What are the monthly revenue and profit growth trends?  
- What percentage of customers are repeat buyers vs one-time?
